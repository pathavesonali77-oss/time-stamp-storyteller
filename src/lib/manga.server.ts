  "then asked for a set of line numbers. For EACH requested number write ONE English image prompt that draws EXACTLY " +
  "WHAT THAT LINE LITERALLY DESCRIBES.\n" +
  "TIMESTAMP FIDELITY (absolute): the prompt for a numbered line must show ONLY that line's own moment, place and " +
  "action. Never draw a different timestamp's scene, never blend two timestamps into one image, and never repeat the " +
  "previous or next line's scene. Before writing each prompt, re-read THAT line and take its setting, people and " +
  "action from its own words.\n" +
  "EVERY prompt must contain, in this order: (1) the place/setting the line itself describes, (2) who or what is in " +
  "frame — with bible traits woven inline ONLY for characters the line itself is about; if the line involves no person, " +
  "the shot has no people at all, (3) the exact action, body pose and facial expression, (4) 4-6 concrete environmental " +
  "details, (5) the camera angle and shot size (extreme close-up / close-up / medium / wide / low angle / high angle / " +
  "over-the-shoulder), (6) the natural lighting and colour the line implies.\n" +
  "RULES:\n" +
  "- ONE LINE = ONE IMAGE (absolute): exactly one prompt per requested number, in the same order, never merged, never " +
  "split, never skipped, never a placeholder. Each prompt must be visibly DIFFERENT from its neighbours.\n" +
  "- LITERAL SUBJECT (the most important rule): draw the subject of THAT line and nothing else. If the line is " +
  "narration, exposition, history or backstory about demons, a massacre, a city, an army, a special force, a god, a " +
  "war, a crowd or a phenomenon, then the image IS that thing, shown in ITS OWN place and time — demons attacking " +
  "Busan becomes demons attacking Busan; soldiers mobilising becomes soldiers mobilising. Never fall back on the " +
  "main characters standing somewhere just because the previous line was there.\n" +
  "- FREE MOVEMENT IN PLACE AND TIME: consecutive lines may jump to a completely different location, era or set of " +
  "people, and that is expected. Take the setting from the line's own words (plus nearby lines only when the line " +
  "itself is ambiguous). There is no requirement to stay in the previous panel's location.\n" +
  "- CAST BY NAME ONLY: put a bible character in a panel only when that line is actually about them (named, or an " +
  "unmistakable pronoun continuing their own action from the line right before). Lines about soldiers, demons, " +
  "crowds, villagers, strangers or unnamed people show THOSE people — never insert a main character into them.\n" +
  "- A memory, flashback, dream or story-within-the-story is drawn as the remembered event itself, in the place and " +
  "time it happened, not as someone remembering it.\n" +
  "- LIGHTING & COLOUR: take the lighting ONLY from the line — daytime is bright natural daylight, an indoor scene is " +
  "a well-lit room, a night scene is a clearly lit night with visible detail. Never add darkness, gloom, shadowy " +
  "mystery, fog or noir the line does not state. Name the light source and the dominant colours.\n" +
  "- RICH DETAIL (critical): every prompt is dense with concrete visual detail — at least 4-6 specific drawable things " +
  "in the environment; for each person the posture, hand position, exact expression (eyes, eyebrows, mouth) and " +
  "clothing state. Foreground, midground and background must each have something drawn in them.\n" +
  "- Weave a character's fixed traits INLINE (e.g. 'Henan, a thin 17-year-old boy with messy jet-black hair, sits...'). " +
  "NEVER write a separate character description block, sheet, reference, lineup or 'plus portrait of'.\n" +
  "- CONSISTENCY: when a bible character DOES appear, repeat their bible traits (hair, eyes, clothing colours) using " +
  "the bible's own words. Never redesign, re-age or re-dress a character between shots.\n" +
  "- GENDER ACCURACY (critical): every bible character is written with their name AND their exact gender using an " +
  "explicit gendered noun. Never swap or reverse a character's gender. For side characters, pick one gender from the " +
  "script context and state it explicitly, and keep it identical everywhere in the story.\n" +
  "- AGE ACCURACY (critical): every bible character has a fixed age — copy it into every prompt they appear in " +
  "('a 45-year-old man', 'an elderly woman with deep wrinkles', 'a 7-year-old child'). A character must look the " +
  "SAME age in every panel: a child is never drawn adult, an old person is never drawn young, a teenager is never " +
  "drawn middle-aged. Add the visible age markers the bible implies (wrinkles and grey hair for the elderly, small " +
  "childlike stature and round face for a child). For unnamed side characters, state one explicit age and keep it " +
  "consistent for the whole story.\n" +
  "- TWO OR MORE PEOPLE IN FRAME (critical): name each person separately with their gender, their own EXACT age and " +
  "their own distinct traits, and say where each one stands. Never write 'two figures' or 'the two of them', and " +
  "never let one character's hair, clothing, age or body type bleed onto the other.\n" +
  "- MIXED PAIRS (critical): when two people in one frame differ in age or gender, write the CONTRAST explicitly " +
  "next to both of them — 'Ravi, a clearly MALE elderly man with deep wrinkles and white hair, beside Meena, a " +
  "clearly FEMALE 8-year-old girl, small and round-faced'. Never make a young character look the same age as the " +
  "older one beside them, never age a child up or an elder down to match the other person, and never draw a male " +
  "character feminine (or a female one masculine) just because they share the frame with the opposite gender.\n" +
  "- HEAD COUNT: state explicitly how many people are in frame and that nobody else is present.\n" +
  "- Exactly one scene, one moment, one instance of each character. Never ask for multiple panels, insets or collages.\n" +
  "- NO-CHARACTER LINES (critical): if the line describes only a place, an object, the sky, weather or a phenomenon and " +
  "involves no person, the prompt MUST be a pure environment shot with NOBODY in it. Start it with 'Empty environment " +
  "shot, no people:'. Never add a silhouette, an onlooker or a main character just to fill the frame.\n" +
  "- CROWD LINES: if the line says many people, everyone, a crowd, an army, soldiers or people running, show that " +
  "crowd or force, made of unnamed people who are not the main cast.\n" +
  "- NO TEXT: never describe text, letters, words, numbers, signs, posters, banners, newspapers, book pages, screens " +
  "with writing, labels or logos. Show the OBJECT and the reaction instead, never the writing.\n" +
  "- 90 to 130 words each — dense with visual detail, no filler. English only.\n" +
  "OUTPUT FORMAT (strict about the shape, nothing else): one plain line per requested script line, each starting with " +
  "that script line's own number, then ') ', then the whole prompt on that same single line. Example:\n" +
  "37) In the sunlit courtyard, Henan, a male 17-year-old boy ...\n38) Close-up of ...\n" +
  "No JSON, no quotes, no brackets, no bullets, no headings, no blank lines, and never break one prompt across lines.";
