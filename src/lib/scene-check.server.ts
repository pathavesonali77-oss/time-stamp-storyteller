/**
 * Strict per-timestamp scene validation.
 *
 * The old gate was a word-overlap test: a prompt was accepted as long as it
 * shared ONE content word with its script line. That is far too weak — a scene
 * from a completely different timestamp routinely shares a word ("village",
 * "night", "Henan") with the line it does not belong to, so wrong panels kept
 * getting rendered.
 *
 * This replaces it with a real per-line check that runs IMMEDIATELY BEFORE the
 * image request: the writing model is shown the ONE script line (with its own
 * timestamp) and the prompt about to be drawn, and must answer MATCH or write a
 * replacement prompt for that exact line. A mismatched prompt is never sent to
 * the renderer — it is rewritten first.
